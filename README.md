# lc3-vm
This repository implements a simple LC3 virtual machine in both haskell and rust as a learning exercise. The lc3 vm implemented here can be run with any of the ```.obj``` files in the source directory. The code works with the two games and a simple hello world program. 

Feel free to 
  1. suggest improvements using an issue or raising a PR 
  2. contribute test cases for both rust/haskell
  3. write new ports of the vm in other languages!
